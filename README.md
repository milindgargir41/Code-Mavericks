# Checkpoint 1 – Day 2 Update (2:00 PM IST)

## What’s Completed

### Unified HTML Structure
- Combined **all application sections** (Government, Institution, Verification, About) into a **single HTML file** for simplicity and centralized management.
- Well-organized layout with clear sections demarcated using semantic tags and IDs.

### Full CSS Styling
- Created and linked a **dedicated external CSS stylesheet** for consistent and clean styling.
- Utilized **inline styles** in certain areas where context-specific styling was needed.
- Responsive layout considerations are in place.

### Basic JavaScript Integration
- Used **inline JavaScript** for a few interactive elements (like toggling views, wallet status, etc.).
- Ensures foundational interactivity without yet fully connecting to blockchain logic.

## Next Steps: JavaScript Logic Development

### JavaScript Phase Goals:
  - Create reusable functions for:
  - Wallet connect/disconnect
  - Certificate form handling
  - Access control (Gov/Admin/Institute)
  - Add dynamic DOM manipulation for real-time previews and field validation.
  - Integrate with **MetaMask** and **Ethers.js** for smart contract interaction.
